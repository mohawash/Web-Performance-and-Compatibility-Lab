#Web Performance and Compatibility Lab
A lab for checking and fixing modern web interoperability issues on a simple front-end website. The lab looks at Microsoft Edge specifically but the principles applies to interoperability and compatibility with all modern browsers. The lab also features an exercise on improving front-end performance.

Written as a front-end lab that can be executed on any operating system with any editing software, though [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the editor used in the instructions.

This lab is designed to accompany by [Martin Kearn's](http://aka.ms/martinkearn) 'Web Performance and Compatibility' talk, but feel free to use it in isolation.
